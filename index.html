Input: sentence

Initialize length_counter = 0
Initialize word_counter = 1       // Start at 1 because words are separated by spaces; at least one word
Initialize vowel_counter = 0

For each character c in sentence:
    Increment length_counter by 1

    If c is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u or A, E, I, O, U):
        Increment vowel_counter by 1

    If c is a space:
        Increment word_counter by 1

Output length_counter
Output word_counter
Output vowel_counter
